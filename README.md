# pyAsciiTermGraphics
This is a small library for creating ASCII graphics in the terminal with Python!

## Usage & Installation:
Once Python 3 is installed on your system, you need to clone the repository.
Then in the repositories folder, create a new file - in the file copy all the lines of code from main.py to check it works.

If you don't get any errors, you should be good to go - just have a look at the main.py file to work out how to use the library - it should have enough information.

If you get any errors, bugs, or have any ideas for new features, please feel free to either create a Github issue or contribute to this project - just fork it, clone it, change it, and send a pull request!
