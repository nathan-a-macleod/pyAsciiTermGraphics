# pyAsciiTermGraphics
This is a small library for creating ASCII graphics in the terminal with Python!

## Usage & Installation:
To install this, you must first have Python 3 installed. I won't go over this in any detail because there are loads tutorials on the internet.

Once Python 3 is installed on your system, you need to clone the repository. Then, you can run the example file (main.py) with python3.

Hopefully the example file will have enough details for you to get started. If you want to make another file, you need to include the pyAsciiTermGraphics.py file for it to work.

## Contributing
It would be great if you could contribute to this project - just fork it, clone it, change it, and send a pull request!
